Very simple Discord bot for Octopath Champions of the Continent.
Currently has 15 commands:
/help /about /credits /unit /unitlist /attribute /attributelist /buff /debuff /pet /petlist /petbuff /petdebuff /divinebeast /divinebeastlist
Uses fuzzywuzzy for approximate search.
For the BOT_TOKEN, make sure to create a .env file with a single line like:
BOT_TOKEN=<TOKEN_HERE>
